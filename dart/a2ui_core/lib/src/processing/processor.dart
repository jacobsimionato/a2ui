/// The central processor for A2UI messages on renderer side.
///
/// It consumes the agent-to-renderer messages
/// (`createSurface`, `updateComponents`, `updateDataModel`, `deleteSurface`)
/// and builds the surface state a renderer draws from. An agent can also run
/// it headlessly, to evaluate the UI its own payload would produce.
///
/// Not to be confused with the Agent SDK's `A2uiRequestProcessor`, which runs
/// the other way: it parses model output into the payloads this consumes.
///
/// This is the entry point for validation as well as for processing, because
/// it is what holds every supported [catalogs] entry and can therefore decide
/// which catalog each item belongs to. [PayloadValidator] checks one component,
/// function call or theme against one catalog; the processor resolves that
/// catalog per item and calls [validatorFor] for it. That split is what lets a
/// surface mix catalogs, which v1.0 allows through the `catalogId` a component
/// or function call may carry to override the surface-level default.
///
/// [processMessages] is the entry point for both sides. It takes an
/// [AgentToRendererMessagePayload] — a batch of parsed messages, a lone
/// message, or raw decoded JSON — and applies it to the surface state,
/// checking each message against the surface it joins as it goes, so graph
/// checks resolve references against what the surface already holds. An agent
/// checks its own output the same way, over a processor it keeps for the
/// session: the state it builds up is what makes an incremental update
/// checkable rather than waved through.
///
/// Validation is phased rather than a single pass: envelopes are checked as
/// the payload is parsed, a surface's theme when the surface is created, each
/// batch of components against its catalog and against the merged graph as the
/// batch arrives, and every surface the payload created as one graph once the
/// payload has been applied in full. That last pass is what [validationConfig]
/// governs: a root, references that resolve and components reachable from the
/// root are the three things a message cannot answer on arrival, because a
/// payload may declare a parent before its child.
