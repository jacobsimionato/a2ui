"""System functions the runtime supplies to every catalog.

The protocol reserves the `@` namespace for functions the renderer provides, so
a system function is available to any catalog whose protocol version defines it,
including catalogs that never declare it.

A system function is defined once, here, in terms of the version-neutral types
in `a2ui.core.schema.common_types`. It carries the protocol version that
introduced it and remains available in every version after that, so a new
protocol version inherits the whole set without registering anything. A version
that wants these functions in its catalog references them, as
`basic_catalog/v1_0/function_impls.py` does.
